/**
 * Initializes and starts the Apollo Server.
 *
 * This asynchronous function sets up and starts an instance of Apollo Server configured with GraphQL
 * type definitions and resolvers. It uses Prisma Client for database interactions, integrating it through
 * the server's context. The server listens on a specified port (default is 4000) for incoming GraphQL requests.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The Apollo Server is set up with GraphQL schema (`typeDefs`) and resolver functions (`resolvers`).
 * - The `startStandaloneServer` function from `@apollo/server/standalone` is used for easier setup.
 * - Server's context is prepared to include the Prisma client instance.
 * - On successful startup, the URL of the server is logged to the console.
 * - In case of an error during startup, the error is caught and logged.
 * - Ensures that the Prisma client disconnects gracefully when the server stops or an error occurs.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Catches and logs any error that occurs during server startup or Prisma client setup.
